# Explore Weather Trends - Udacity Project

This work is based on a project from the Data Analyst Nanodegree of Udacity. It shows my approach to analyze weather trends in the given project. The dataset has been given. The approach of analysis is rather basic and underlies therefore certain conditions and limitations. 

Please find the observations, results and the applied data wrangling methods in the Jupyter Notebook file.

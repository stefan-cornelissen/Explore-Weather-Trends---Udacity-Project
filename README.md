# Explore-Weather-Trends---Udacity-Project-Nanodegree-Data-Analyst
This work is based on a project from the Data Analyst Nanodegree of Udacity. It shows my approach to analyze weather trends in the given project. The dataset has been given. The approach of analysis is rather basic and underlies therefore certain conditions and limitations (mentioned at the end of the project).
